PERPLEXITY SCORE: 9/10

SUMMARY:
AI-powered browsers like those from OpenAI and Perplexity introduce significant new security vulnerabilities—especially prompt injection attacks—that can hijack user sessions, expose sensitive data, and automate malicious actions, posing systemic risks not present in traditional browsers[1][2][4].

CONTENT PREVIEW:
New AI-powered web browsers such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT Atlas and Perplexity’s Comet are trying to unseat Google Chrome as the front door to the internet for billions of users. A key selling point of these products are their web browsing AI agents, which promise to complete tasks on a user’s behalf by clicking around on websites and filling out forms.
But consumers may not be aware of the major risks to user privacy that come along with agentic browsing, a problem that the entire tech industry is trying to grapple with.








Cybersecurity experts who spoke to TechCrunch say AI browser agents pose a larger risk to user privacy compared to traditional browsers. They say consumers should consider how much access they give web browsing AI agents, and whether the purported benefits outweigh the...

PERPLEXITY SCORE: 9/10

SUMMARY:
The article emphasizes the growing importance of Answer Engine Optimization (AEO) for B2B marketers as AI-powered search tools like ChatGPT and Google AI Overviews change how users find information. It advises marketers to adopt AEO strategies—such as prompt management and content optimization for AI responses—to maintain visibility and influence in AI-driven search environments beyond traditional SEO methods.

CONTENT PREVIEW:
Artificial intelligence (AI) is becoming a major factor in search. Not only has Google introduced AI Overviews, which summarize results at the top of the screen, AI engines like ChatGPT and Perplexity are taking a share of searches away from Google, and present search results in an entirely different way. ChatGPT in particular has grown explosively in 2025‚ reaching 100 million users in only two months.
Despite everyone’s familiarity with Google AI Overviews, not many B2B marketers are diving into “Answer Engine Optimization” to manage AI results across all new AI answer engines yet. Google search still has a 90% market share, and there are still links below the AI summary, so the majority of searches mostly still work the old fashioned way.
Until AI search becomes the norm, many marketers...

Salesforce AI Research announces framework to optimize agent capability and consistency through synthetic data, realistic testing, and reinforcement learning.
Even as AI models grow more sophisticated, a curious challenge persists: systems that solve PhD-level mathematics struggle with surprisingly simple tasks. Ask a leading language model the famous riddle “Where does Christmas come before Thanksgiving?” and it correctly answers “in the dictionary”—because alphabetically, ‘C’ precedes ‘T.’But swap the words—ask “Where does Thanksgiving come before Christmas?”—and watch the same model con...

PERPLEXITY SCORE: 8/10

SUMMARY:
OpenAI is reportedly developing a generative music tool that can create music from text or audio prompts, potentially enabling users to add music to videos or accompaniment to vocal tracks, expanding creative and practical applications for content creators[1][3].

CONTENT PREVIEW:
OpenAI is working on a new tool that would generate music based on text and audio prompts, according to a report in The Information.
Such a tool could be used to add music to existing videos, or to add guitar accompaniment to an existing vocal track, sources said. It’s not clear when OpenAI plans to launch such a tool or whether it would be available as a standalone product (as opposed to integrating with OpenAI’s ChatGPT and video app Sora).








One source told The Information that OpenAI is working with some students from the Juilliard School to annotate scores as a way to provide training data.
While OpenAI has launched generative music models in the past, they predate the launch of ChatGPT; more recently, the company has been developing audio models focused on text-to-speech and sp...

SUMMARY:
A serious high-severity vulnerability (CVE-2025-62518) named TARmageddon was found in the Rust async-tar library and its many forks, including the widely used but unmaintained tokio-tar. This flaw allows remote code execution by exploiting how TAR archive headers are parsed, posing significant risks to build systems, containerized applications, and cloud-native environments that rely on these libraries. Due to the original project's abandonment, patching has been complicated, urging users to migrate to actively maintained forks like astral-tokio-tar to mitigate the threat[1][2][3][4].

The White House’s recent executive orders on artificial intelligence and the launch of America’s AI Action Plan have made one thing clear: The United States intends to lead the world in AI.
To be sure, the policy direction is ambitious: Accelerate innovation, strengthen infrastructure and ensure fairness and safety. But as important as these goals are, rules and principles alone cannot deliver trust.
The next frontier in AI governance is not about writing more rules. It’s about making them work.

OpenAI launched ChatGPT Atlas, an AI-powered browser currently available on macOS, which integrates ChatGPT directly into the browsing experience to assist with tasks like webpage summarization and inline editing.

OpenAI launched an AI-powered web browser called ChatGPT Atlas this week, which makes me wonder: Is it finally time to ditch Safari?
That news was on our minds as Max Zeff, Sean O’Kane, and I discussed the browser landscape — including some lesser-known alternatives — on the latest episode of the Equity podcast. But it doesn’t sound like any of us will be making a big switch soon.








For one thing, Sean noted many companies have tried and ultimately failed to unseat the major browsers due to their inability to make money on the browser alone. Of course, that’s less likely to be a problem for OpenAI, with its increasingly massive funding rounds.
Max, meanwhile, has actually tried out Atlas and other browsers that promise AI agents will do the work for you, and he said there’s a “slight...

PERPLEXITY SCORE: 3/10

SUMMARY:
A high school AI security system in Baltimore County mistakenly identified a student's crumpled Doritos bag as a firearm, leading to a police search and handcuffing. The incident highlights challenges and potential flaws in AI-based security detection systems.

CONTENT PREVIEW:
A high school student in Baltimore County, Maryland was reportedly handcuffed and searched after an AI security system flagged his bag of chips as a possible firearm.
Taki Allen, a student at Kenwood High School, told CNN affiliate WBAL, “I was just holding a Doritos bag — it was two hands and one finger out, and they said it looked like a gun.” But as a result, Allen said, “They made me get on my knees, put my hands behind my back, and cuffed me.” 








In a statement shared with parents, Principal Katie Smith said the school’s security department had reviewed and canceled a gun detection alert, while Smith (who didn’t immediately realize the alert had been canceled) reported the situation to the school resource officer, who called the local police.

PERPLEXITY SCORE: 3/10

SUMMARY:
BlaBlaCar, a global ride-sharing platform, is experiencing rapid growth in India, with passenger numbers expected to reach 20 million in 2025, a 50% increase from the previous year. After initially withdrawing from the Indian market in 2017 due to competition, BlaBlaCar has seen a strong resurgence driven by a young, mobile-first demographic seeking cost-effective and tech-enabled mobility solutions[2][1].

CONTENT PREVIEW:
Every few weekends, 21-year-old student Lavanya Jain opens the BlaBlaCar app to find a lift from Noida on the outskirts of New Delhi to his home in Kandhla, a small town in northern India’s Uttar Pradesh state. The 120-kilometer journey costs him about ₹500, the equivalent of about $6. That’s a fraction of the ₹1,500–₹2,000, or $17–$23, he would pay for a private cab. 
“If you’re looking for a fast, efficient, affordable, and comfortable way to travel — and you like to chat — you should basically check out BlaBlaCar,” Jain told TechCrunch, adding that he has used the app some 40 to 50 times over the past two years.








Jain is one of millions of Indians turning to long-distance carpooling as a cheaper, more social way to travel between cities. That surge has made India the company’s la...
